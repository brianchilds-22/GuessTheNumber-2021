# GuessTheNumber-2021

Number guessing game developed with Vanilla Javascript mostly focusing on DOM manipulation.

The user selects a number and clicks the check button the game then displays weather the guess is too high or too low. The user has 5 chances to get the correct number. When the correct number is selected the background color turns green and the "Congrats! You Win" message displays along with a "Correct Number" message and the ? reveals the correct number. The highscore is also recorded. Clicking the Again button reloads the program. After 5 guesses are used and the correct number hasn't been selected the background color turns red and the "You Lost! Try Again" and "Game Over try again" messages are displayed.
